# Day 1

- Cpp is a case sensitive language
- `;` is called a terminator
- `#include <iostream>` is a preprocessor declarative
- `cout << "output"` prints something
- `//` used for comments
  
1. How does a Code run?
   after running the `.cpp` file it creates a `.exe` file
   __In Terminal:__
    `Bash` 
    `` g++ filename.cpp ``
    after this
    `` ./a.exe``

## Variable
Lets take Ram as some area and all the area is covered by empty boxes
as soon as we initialize some variable one of the box get filled by 
by the value in variable and that box get named as the variable name

- variable are also known as __Identifires__

## Data Types

These are all Primitive Datatypes:
- int: stores integer
  - Takes 4 bytes of space
- char: stores character
  - Takes 1 bytes of space
- float: stores decimal value
  - Takes 1byte
  - PI = 3.14f; // f is used to tell the program we are not using double
- bool: stores falsy and truthy values (0 and 1)
  - Takes 1 byte
  - in computer printing a bool will only results in either 1 or 0
  - 0 --> false
  - 1 --> true
- double: range of storing float gets larger
